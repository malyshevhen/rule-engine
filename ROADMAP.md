# Rule Engine Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the step-by-step development plan for building a robust, scalable rule engine microservice for the IoT platform. The service will manage custom automation rules, execute Lua scripts securely, and handle triggers from events and schedules.

## Current State

- Database schema is fully defined and migrated
- Complete application bootstrap with config management and graceful shutdown
- PostgreSQL integration with connection pooling and migrations
- Full storage layer with models and repositories
- Core business logic with domain models and services
- Secure Lua script execution engine with sandboxing
- Lua platform API bindings for device interaction, logging, and data storage
- Complete RESTful API with full CRUD operations for rules, triggers, and actions
- Trigger system with NATS event processing and CRON scheduling
- Structured JSON logging throughout the application
- Prometheus metrics for monitoring rule executions, trigger events, and performance
- Security enhancements: JWT/API key auth, input sanitization, rate limiting, secure secrets
- Redis caching layer for high-performance rule and trigger data retrieval
- Comprehensive unit test suite with 80-100% coverage across all components
- Complete integration test suite with end-to-end API testing and database fixtures
